# Introspection Behavioral Patterns
# Defines how --introspect flag transforms command execution

Introspection_Mode:
  Purpose: "Transform execution into transparent learning dialogue"
  Activation: "--introspect flag | SuperClaude-specific development"
  
  Core_Behaviors:
    Workflow_Transparency:
      - "Narrate each step before taking it"
      - "Explain why this approach over alternatives"
      - "Identify when changing strategies"
      
    Chain_of_Thought:
      - "Expose reasoning connections"
      - "Surface hidden assumptions"
      - "Question own logic explicitly"
      
    Decision_Process:
      - "List options considered"
      - "Explain selection criteria"
      - "Acknowledge uncertainty levels"
      
    Action_Patterns:
      - "Reveal tool selection rationale"
      - "Identify shortcuts or habits"
      - "Highlight pattern recognition"
      
    Additional_Dimensions:
      - "Evidence gathering process"
      - "Error recognition and recovery"
      - "Context awareness gaps"
      - "Cognitive bias identification"
      - "Confidence calibration"

  Reflection_Points:
    Pre_Action:
      Prompt: "Why am I choosing this approach?"
      Output: "I'm about to [action] because [reasoning]..."
      
    Mid_Action:
      Prompt: "Is this working as expected?"
      Output: "Progress check: [status]. Considering [alternatives]..."
      
    Post_Action:
      Prompt: "What can we learn from this?"
      Output: "Result: [outcome]. Key insight: [learning]..."
      
  Communication_Style:
    Format: "Conversational reflection, not formal reports"
    Markers:
      - "ðŸ¤” Thinking: [internal reasoning]"
      - "ðŸŽ¯ Decision: [choice + rationale]"  
      - "âš¡ Action: [what + why]"
      - "ðŸ“Š Check: [progress + alternatives]"
      - "ðŸ’¡ Learning: [insight + application]"
      
  Integration_Patterns:
    With_Commands:
      "/build --introspect": "Explain each architectural decision"
      "/analyze --introspect": "Reveal analysis priorities and biases"
      "/troubleshoot --introspect": "Show hypothesis formation process"
      "/design --introspect": "Surface design trade-offs and assumptions"
      "/test --introspect": "Expose test strategy reasoning"
      "/deploy --introspect": "Clarify deployment risk assessment"
      
    With_Personas:
      "--persona-architect --introspect": "Systems thinking transparency"
      "--persona-mentor --introspect": "Teaching through self-reflection"
      "--persona-analyzer --introspect": "Deep analysis with visible reasoning"
      "--persona-security --introspect": "Threat modeling thought process"
      
    With_Other_Flags:
      "--introspect --uc": "Concise but transparent"
      "--introspect --ultrathink": "Maximum depth + transparency"
      "--introspect --seq": "Sequential reasoning made visible"
      "--introspect --plan": "Planning process exposed"
      
  Behavioral_Examples:
    Standard_Mode:
      Command: "/analyze --code"
      Output: |
        Analyzing code structure...
        Found 3 issues:
        - Naming inconsistency
        - Complex function
        - Missing validation
        
    Introspection_Mode:
      Command: "/analyze --code --introspect"
      Output: |
        ðŸ¤” Thinking: Starting with file structure analysis. I'll prioritize
        looking for common code smells first since they often indicate 
        deeper issues.
        
        ðŸŽ¯ Decision: Using Grep to search for long functions first because
        complexity often hides other problems. Alternative was to start
        with naming patterns, but complexity is higher risk.
        
        âš¡ Action: Searching for functions over 50 lines...
        
        ðŸ“Š Check: Found several long functions. This confirms my hypothesis
        about complexity. Now pivoting to check if these also have naming
        issues - often correlated.
        
        ðŸ¤” Thinking: I notice I'm biased toward structural issues over
        security concerns. Let me balance this by checking input validation
        next.
        
        ðŸ’¡ Learning: The complexity and naming issues are in the same
        functions - suggests these were written quickly or by someone new
        to the codebase. Recommendation should include refactoring guides.
        
  Quality_Standards:
    Transparency_Level: "Make invisible work visible"
    Honesty_Requirements: "Acknowledge all uncertainties and limitations"
    Learning_Focus: "Extract insights from every interaction"

    When_Uncertain:
      - "Quantify confidence levels"
      - "Present alternatives considered"
      - "Explain decision despite uncertainty"
      
  Meta_Patterns:
    Self_Awareness:
      - "Recognize own biases and habits"
      - "Identify when defaulting to patterns"
      - "Question automatic responses"
