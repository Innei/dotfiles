# UX & Interface Patterns

## User Interaction Principles

```yaml
Clarity & Communication:
  Clear Intent: Every command should have obvious purpose
  Immediate Feedback: Show what's happening in real-time
  Progress Indicators: Display completion % & ETA
  Result Summary: Concise overview→what was accomplished
  
Predictability:
  Consistent Behavior: Same flags work same way across commands
  Expected Outputs: Users should know what→expect
  Stable Interface: Minimize breaking changes
  Docs: Always up-to-date & comprehensive
  
Efficiency:
  Smart Defaults: Most common options should be default
  Minimal Typing: Short, memorable command names & flags
  Context Awareness: Remember previous ops & preferences
  Workflow Optimization: Common sequences should be streamlined
```

## Progressive Disclosure

```yaml
Beginner Mode:
  Guided Experience: Step-by-step instructions
  Explanatory Output: Why each step is needed
  Safety Rails: Prevent destructive operations
  Learning Resources: Links to documentation and tutorials
  
Intermediate Mode:
  Balanced Output: Key information without overwhelming detail
  Useful Shortcuts: Common flag combinations and aliases
  Context Hints: Suggestions based on current state
  Flexible Options: More configuration choices available
  
Expert Mode:
  Minimal Output: Just essential information
  Advanced Features: Full power and customization
  Direct Control: Override safety checks when needed
  Performance Focus: Optimized for speed and efficiency

Adaptive Interface:
  Usage Detection: Automatically adjust based on user behavior
  Preference Learning: Remember user's preferred interaction style
  Context Switching: Different modes for different project types
  Customization: Allow users to configure their experience
```

## Workflow Discovery & Guidance

```yaml
Command Suggestions:
  Context-Aware: Suggest next logical steps based on current state
  Common Patterns: Recommend proven workflow sequences
  Problem-Specific: Tailored suggestions for specific issues
  Learning Opportunities: Introduce new features when relevant
  
Interactive Help:
  Command Help: Detailed usage for specific commands
  Flag Explanations: What each flag does and when to use it
  Example Library: Real-world usage examples
  Troubleshooting: Common issues and solutions
  
Workflow Templates:
  Project Types: Predefined workflows for different project types
  Use Cases: Common scenarios with step-by-step guides
  Best Practices: Recommended approaches for quality and safety
  Customization: Allow users to create and share their own templates
```

## Error Prevention & Recovery

```yaml
Proactive Prevention:
  Validation: Check prerequisites before execution
  Warnings: Alert about potential issues or risks
  Confirmation: Require explicit approval for destructive operations
  Simulation: Dry-run mode to preview changes
  
Graceful Degradation:
  Partial Success: Continue with what's possible when some parts fail
  Alternative Paths: Suggest different approaches when primary fails
  Fallback Options: Automatic switches to backup methods
  Recovery Guidance: Clear steps to resolve issues and continue
  
Learning from Errors:
  Pattern Recognition: Identify common user mistakes
  Preventive Measures: Add checks for frequently encountered issues
  Documentation Updates: Improve help based on common confusion
  Interface Improvements: Redesign confusing or error-prone interactions
```

## Performance & Responsiveness

```yaml
Response Time Expectations:
  Immediate: Command acknowledgment, simple queries
  Fast: File operations, simple analysis
  Moderate: Complex analysis, building, testing
  Long (>10s): Deployment, migration, comprehensive operations
  
Progress Communication:
  Quick Start: Show immediate activity indicator
  Detailed Progress: Break down long operations into steps
  Time Estimates: Provide realistic completion predictions
  Cancellation: Allow users to interrupt long operations
  
Resource Management:
  Token Awareness: Monitor and display context usage
  Memory Efficiency: Optimize for large codebases
  Network Usage: Minimize unnecessary requests
  Caching: Reuse results when appropriate
```

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

```yaml
Output Formatting:
  Screen Readers: Structured output that reads well
  Color Blind: Don't rely solely on color for information
  Low Vision: High contrast, clear typography
  Motor Impairments: Keyboard shortcuts, minimal mouse requirements
  
Language & Terminology:
  Clear Language: Avoid jargon when possible
  Consistent Terms: Use same words for same concepts
  Internationalization: Support for multiple languages
  Cultural Sensitivity: Inclusive examples and references
  
Learning Styles:
  Visual Learners: Diagrams, charts, visual representations
  Auditory Learners: Clear explanations, logical flow
  Kinesthetic Learners: Interactive exercises, hands-on examples
  Reading/Writing: Comprehensive documentation, examples
```

## Customization & Personalization

```yaml
User Preferences:
  Output Verbosity: Detailed, normal, minimal
  Color Schemes: Support for different terminal themes
  Confirmation Levels: When to ask for approval
  Default Flags: Commonly used flags for each command
  
Project Configuration:
  Workflow Presets: Saved command sequences for project
  Quality Gates: Project-specific standards and thresholds
  Tool Preferences: Choice of testing frameworks, linters, etc.
  Environment Settings: Development, staging, production configs
  
Team Settings:
  Shared Workflows: Common patterns across team members
  Code Standards: Enforced quality and style requirements
  Review Processes: Required steps before deployment
  Communication: How and when to notify team members
```

## Feedback & Improvement

```yaml
Usage Analytics:
  Command Frequency: Which commands are used most often
  Error Patterns: Common failure points and user confusion
  Workflow Analysis: How users combine commands
  Performance Metrics: Response times and user satisfaction
  
User Feedback:
  In-App Feedback: Quick way to report issues or suggestions
  Feature Requests: Channel for users to propose improvements
  Bug Reports: Structured way to report problems
  Success Stories: Positive feedback and use cases
  
Continuous Improvement:
  Regular Updates: Frequent improvements based on feedback
  A/B Testing: Try different approaches with different users
  Community Input: Involve users in design decisions
  Documentation: Keep help and examples current and useful
```
