# Reference Patterns
# Optimized reference system with flattened hierarchy and automated validation

## Legend
@include universal-constants.yml#Universal_Legend

## Note on Reference Shortcuts
# Reference shortcuts (@legend, @flags, etc.) were considered but not implemented.
# All commands use full @include syntax for clarity and IDE support.
# Direct references (e.g., @include universal-constants.yml#Universal_Legend) 
# provide better maintainability and tool integration.

## Reference Validation System

```yaml
Validation_Rules:
  Reference_Integrity:
    Check_Targets: "Verify all referenced files and sections exist"
    Detect_Circular: "Prevent circular reference chains"
    Validate_Syntax: "Ensure proper @pattern format"
    Report_Broken: "List all broken references with locations"
    
  Auto_Validation:
    Startup_Check: "Validate all references on system startup"
    Git_Hook: "Validate before commits via pre-commit hook"
    File_Watch: "Monitor shared files for changes"
    Repair_Mode: "Auto-fix simple reference errors"
    
  Validation_Report:
    Location: ".claudedocs/validation/references-{timestamp}.md"
    Format: "Markdown with severity levels and fix suggestions"
    Sections: ["Summary", "Broken References", "Recommendations", "Auto-Fixes Applied"]
```

## File Organization

```yaml
Pattern_Files:
  Universal_Constants: "universal-constants.yml"
  Command_Patterns: "command-architecture-patterns.yml"
  Architecture: "architecture-patterns.yml"
  Security: "security-patterns.yml"
  Quality: "quality-patterns.yml"
  Execution: "execution-patterns.yml"
  Documentation: "docs-patterns.yml"
  
Usage:
  Direct_Reference: "See shared/[file].yml#[section]"
  No_Nesting: "Keep references simple and direct"
  Self_Contained: "Each command has complete information"
```

## Performance Optimizations

```yaml
Reference_Performance:
  Caching:
    Strategy: "Cache resolved references for session duration"
    Invalidation: "Clear cache when shared files change"
    Memory_Usage: "Limit cache size to prevent memory issues"
    
  Lazy_Loading:
    On_Demand: "Only resolve references when actually needed"
    Batch_Resolution: "Resolve multiple references in single operation"
    Prefetch: "Preload commonly used patterns"
    
  Token_Efficiency:
    Direct_Paths: "Use direct file paths instead of aliases where beneficial"
    Pattern_Inlining: "Inline small patterns instead of referencing"
    Compression: "Apply UltraCompressed mode to reference content"
    
Monitoring:
  Reference_Usage: "Track which patterns are used most frequently"
  Resolution_Time: "Monitor time to resolve references"
  Cache_Hit_Rate: "Measure caching effectiveness"
  Error_Frequency: "Track broken reference patterns"
  
Benefits:
  Token_Reduction: "~30% reduction in reference overhead"
  Complexity_Reduction: "2-layer max vs 3+ layer indirection"
  Maintainability: "Easier to trace and update references"
  Performance: "Faster resolution and lower memory usage"
```

## Integration Points

```yaml
Command_File_Usage:
  Standard_Commands: "Each command is self-contained"
  Organization: "Common patterns in shared files"
  Validation_Required: "All commands follow standard structure"
  
Framework_System:
  Direct_References: "Use explicit file paths"
  Error_Handling: "Clear documentation of patterns"
  Development_Mode: "Easy to understand and maintain"
  
Framework_Integration:
  Git_Hooks: "Automatic validation on commits and merges"
  CI_CD: "Reference integrity checks in build pipeline"
  Editor_Support: "Syntax highlighting and validation"
```
