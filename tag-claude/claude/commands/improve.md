@include shared/flag-inheritance.yml#Universal_Always

Examples:
- `/improve --quality` - Code quality improvements
- `/improve --perf --iterate` - Performance optimization
- `/improve --arch --think-hard` - Architecture refactoring

## Command-Specific Flags
--quality: "Code quality improvements (readability, maintainability, DRY)"
--perf: "Performance optimizations (algorithms, caching, queries)"
--arch: "Architecture improvements (patterns, coupling, scalability)"
--refactor: "Safe refactoring preserving behavior"
--iterate: "Iterative improvement until threshold met"
--threshold: "Quality threshold (low|medium|high|perfect)"
--metrics: "Show before/after metrics"
--safe: "Conservative mode - only safe changes"

## Improvement Categories

**Code Quality:** Naming clarity | Function extraction | Duplication removal | Complexity reduction | Error handling | Type safety
